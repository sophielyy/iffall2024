            <li><p>Gameplay in most game modes of Minecraft consists mainly of adding and destroying a variety of different blocks in a procedurally generated world. With these blocks, players can manipulate the world around them, building and destroying structures. As gameplay in Minecraft is so open and unguided, players often set their own goals and play the game as they see fit. An example of this is the Minecraft minigame, Spleef. </p>
                <p>The player is the person that the user controls in the world. When the user starts a game, the player is put in a world, generated from a random or specified seed, with an empty inventory. The player has a health bar with 10 hearts and can be depleted when they are damaged. Damage to health can be mitigated by armor or the Resistance effect; while health can be restored by keeping the hunger bar full enough or by drinking specific potions.</p>

            <h3>Game Modes</h3>
            <ul class="grid-text">
                <li><h4><em>Survival</em></h4>
                    
                    <p>In this mode, players must gather all their materials to build, craft various items and tools and gain experience points. There is a health, hunger, and armor bar, an inventory, and also an oxygen bar when underwater, suffocating, or in lava. If a player runs out of hearts (health), the player dies and returns to the spawn point.</p>
                </li>
                <li><img src="images/survival.jpg"></li>

                <li><h4><em>Creative</em></h4>
                    <p>This mode is for creating structures and experimenting. The player has access to an infinite amount of almost all blocks and items available and can destroy them instantly. Players cannot die (except when falling into the void in Java Edition), health is not a concern, and players can fly. The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, such as spawn eggs.</p>
                </li>
                <li><img src="images/creative.jpg"></li>

                <li><h4><em>Adventure</em></h4>
                    <p>Players can interact with objects such as levers and buttons, and can interact with mobs. However, they can break blocks only with certain tools, and place only certain blocks, as determined by the designer. This mode is good for adventure maps.</p>
                </li>
                <li><img src="images/adventure.jpg"></li>

                <li><h4><em>Hardcore</em></h4>
                    <p>In this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the difficulty level is permanently set to "Hard", and the player does not respawn after dying. After death, the player cannot interact with the world again and must either delete the map or permanently switch to Spectator mode. Hardcore is not technically a game mode as it cannot be enabled with the /gamemode command.</p>
